# CHPC Student Cluster Competition Training

Hello and welcome to the documentation for CHPC SCC training.

This website will hopefully allow you to prepare yourself for the upcoming challenges that you will face.

It will serve to teach you skills in virtual machines, Linux, Systems Administration, computer hardware and software and management skills.

The sidebar (to the left) of the site will allow you to navigate through the sections that you might want to explore. The structure of the site will follow what you will do in the first round of the competition in June/July and will then deviate on to things that are important for the end-of-year round.

In terms of the structure of the competition, it works as follows:

| Approx. Date                | Event                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| ~ April                     | Applications for teams open.    |
| ~ May                       | Applications for teams close.   |
| ~ Late May                  | Teams selected and emailed.     |
| ~ Late June/Early July      | First round starts (1 week).    |
| ~ Mid to late July          | Final round teams announced.    |
| ~ August/September          | Cluster hardware list released. |
| ~ October                   | Team cluster design deadline.   |
| ~ End of Nov./Start of Dec. | Final round begins.             |

This competition is going to be difficult and stressful. It will test your abilities to learn and adapt as well as your willingness to work as a team and form an efficient work unit with your peers. The experiences and contacts that you will gain through this competition can be invaluable to your future career and even if you do not want to go into HPC or Systems Administration, these skills will help you in other aspects of science and your degrees.
